                <p>
                    Understanding media in today’s world is more than a scholarly exercise, It is a necessary survival skill in a world that has been utterly changed by mass communication. Accepting its importance, Department of Mass Communication has been established in LGU. Students,whether they are practitioners, critics or consumers have to be able to analyse the ways in which mass media is being used to change the world. The board parameters are available here, dealing respectively with the sociology of communication revolution, media and the challenges of the change and some global perspectives on communication dynamics with particular reference to journalism. It is our earnest hope that we provide an understanding of the basic structure of the media oriented age. The graduates of Department of Mass Communication are working in different media organizations, Ad agencies and PR departments. A fully equipped video lab for professional training of students has been established. In future, the department will offer short diploma courses in Editing and Documentary making.
